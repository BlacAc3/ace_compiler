# Python Compiler from Scratch

## Overview

This project is a **compiler built from scratch in Python**. The goal of the project is to provide a hands-on, end-to-end learning experience in compiler construction. The compiler processes source code written in a custom language and converts it into executable bytecode for a stack-based virtual machine.

The project covers the following phases of compiler construction:
- **Lexical Analysis (Lexer):** Tokenizes the source code into meaningful symbols.
- **Syntax Analysis (Parser):** Constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens.
- **Semantic Analysis:** Performs type checking and builds a symbol table.
- **Intermediate Representation (IR) Generation:** Converts the AST into three-address code (TAC).
- **Optimization:** Implements basic optimizations like constant folding, dead code elimination, and common subexpression elimination.
- **Code Generation:** Translates optimized IR into bytecode instructions.
- **Virtual Machine (VM):** Executes the bytecode using a stack-based approach.

## Features

- **Custom Lexer and Parser:** Robust handling of identifiers, numbers, keywords, operators, comments, and control flow statements (`if`, `else`, `while`).
- **Semantic Analysis:** Detects undeclared variables and type mismatches.
- **IR Generation:** Produces three-address code with temporary variables and control flow labels.
- **Optimizations:** Performs constant folding and eliminates dead code and common subexpressions.
- **Stack-Based Virtual Machine:** Executes generated bytecode with support for conditional jumps and loops.
- **Extensible:** The project is designed to be expanded with additional features such as do-while loops, function calls, and more sophisticated optimizations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for running unit tests
- [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blacac3/ace_compiler.git
   cd ace_compiler
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Compiler:**

   To compile and execute a source file, run the main script:

   ```bash
   python src/main.py path/to/source_file.txt
   ```

2. **Testing the Compiler:**

   Run the unit tests using pytest:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

3. **Example Test Source Code:**

   Use a multi-line string to test various language features:

   ```c
   // Example test program
   x = 10 + 5;
   y = x * 2;
   z = 30;
   if (x < y) {
       a = x + y;
       b = a * 2;
       if (b == 60) {
           c = b - x;
       } else {
           c = b + x;
       }
   } else {
       a = y - x;
       c = a + z;
   }
   while (c < 100) {
       c = c + 5;
       x = x + 1;
   }
   result = c * 2;
   final = result + x - y;
   ```
